# TensorFlow
###### An open-source software library for Machine Intelligence

We’ll go over the basics of using TensorFlow in Python. The bulk of the talk will go over how to create a digit recognizer, i.e. a network that can recognize images of the numbers 0 through 9. In the process, we’ll go over terms in machine learning, including cost functions and backpropagation. If we have time, we’ll go over how to implement other machine learning techniques in TensorFlow.
No machine learning experience is required. It’d be helpful if the attendees are familiar with Python. It would also help if they install TensorFlow beforehand.
