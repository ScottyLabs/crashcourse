    Augmented reality applications have the power to transform a user's environment
    into a game or interactive experience.  They blend the digital and physical
    worlds, enabling new, more immersive modes of interaction.  But while AR apps
    may look and feel sophisticated, they don't have to be hard to make.  In this
    talk, we'll walk you through using Unity and the Vuforia API to make your own
    augmented reality apps come to life.

We’ll cover the different types of tracking methods and build a quick demo
application without any code.  After that, we’ll touch on Unity scripting as
well as a few other skills you’ll need to make a full application.

## How to Attend

Bring a computer that has a web camera and [Unity](https://store.unity.com/)
installed.  You’ll need to create a free Unity account to do this.  We’ll also
walk you through making a Vuforia account
[here](https://developer.vuforia.com/user/register).  You can also come without
a computer and just follow along.
