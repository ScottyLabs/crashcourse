  This should be a one (maybe two) paragraph description of the talk. In my
  particular case, I maybe want to outline what specificly makes my talk fancy,
  how it got to be that way, and what you can do to give fancy talks as well.

  Note that you can use __Markdown__ syntax freely within this block, so feel
  free to emphasize or [insert links](#).

# Google Cloud Platform
###### Creating and launching with App Engine


[Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/) is a platform for building scalable web applications and mobile and IoT backends. App Engine provides built-in services and APIs, such as NoSQL datastores, memcache, and a user authentication API, common to most applications.

Participants will be able to follow along as we create and deploy a small App Engine application that displays a short message. The demo that we will run can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java/quickstart), and users should come prepared with Java SE 8 Development Kit, Google Cloud SDK, Apache Maven, and Git installed. Basic coding experience is helpful, but not necessary!
