  This should be a one (maybe two) paragraph description of the talk. In my
  particular case, I maybe want to outline what specificly makes my talk fancy,
  how it got to be that way, and what you can do to give fancy talks as well.

  Note that you can use __Markdown__ syntax freely within this block, so feel
  free to emphasize or [insert links](#).

This section can be treated as "below the fold" content. Use it however you
wish. You may want to elaborate on things people should do before attending,
more details about what you'll cover, etc. You'll want to link to the resources
that you reference, or even write up talk notes here.

Feel free to write as much as you'd like, and you're free to use the full power
of Markdown here.
