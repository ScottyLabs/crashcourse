title: Typography & Grid
subtitle: learn to craft well-designed sites
description: >
    It’s often hard to identify what components contribute to a site feeling
    “well-designed.” Indeed it’s been said that “Good design is invisible. It’s
    only when something is poorly designed that we notice.” In this talk, we’ll
    dissect two elements of good design: typography and grid.
speaker: Jake Zimmerman

Participants in this workshop will complete typographic sketches and mockups to
get a feel for how to think critically about design on the web.

## How to Attend

Bring a pencil; paper will be provided. Also bring a laptop with your favorite
design software installed, like [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/),
[InDesign](http://www.adobe.com/downloads.html), or
[Illustrator](http://www.adobe.com/downloads.html). If you don’t have something
like this already installed, you can use the links above to find free trials.
Alternatively, attend the workshop with a friend who has this software already
installed. The Mac cluster computers will be available as well.
