This talk is targeted towards those who know the basics of programming, but with
little or no experience in Android development. Some experience with Java or a
similar object-oriented programming language is recommended.

You'll need to have following:

- A laptop (Windows, OSX, or Linux are all fine!)
- Download and install Android Studio, as well as the SDK packages and emulator
  images for the most recent version of Android (the site will walk you through
  this)
- (optional) An Android phone and USB cable to test your app on a real phone!
