The HTML and CSS talk will do two things. The first is to show your how to write
HTML and CSS code that will render a webpage just the way you want. The second
is to give you a basic understanding of the structure of webpages, known as the
DOM. Both are important if you would like to learn to make more interactive
websites using JavaScript.

## How to Attend

No prior web development experience is required. Familiarity with programming in
general is certainly useful but by no means required.

Bring a computer with a web browser and text editor installed. We recommend
Chrome and [Atom](https://atom.io/). If you prefer another text editor, such as
Sublime Text, Notepad++ or Vim, feel free to use that editor instead.

[Brackets](http://brackets.io) is an editor specifically designed for web
development. While we won't be covering how to use it, it is a good thing to
check out if you intend to do a lot of web development in the future.
