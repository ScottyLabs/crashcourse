description: >
  JavaScript frameworks let you collect and structure your code to enable you to
  write sophisticated client-side applications easily. React is based on the
  principle of "functional reactivity": all you need is to keep track of your
  data and how to display it.<br><br>

  By not conflating these goals, React enables developers to write even very
  complicated apps without having to struggle managing the weight of complicated
  business logic.
