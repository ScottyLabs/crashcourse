name: react
title: React.js
subtitle: facebook's ever-hyped JavaScript framework
description: >
  JavaScript frameworks let you collect and structure your code to enable you to
  write sophisticated client-side applications easily. React is based on the
  principle of "functional reactivity": all you need is to keep track of your
  data and how to display it.<br><br>

  By not conflating these goals, React enables developers to write even very
  complicated apps without having to struggle managing the weight of complicated
  business logic.

So you know how to make static HTML websites. You write a CSS style sheet like no body's business. But how do you make complex websites that respond to the user's input? This is where react excels. Learn about the virtual DOM, React components, and JSX in order to simple painless interactive UIs.

This talk assumes that you've programmed in JavaScript before. You don't have to
be an absolute expert, but familiarity with the syntax will be somewhat assumed.
This is because React itself introduces a new syntax _on top_ of JavaScript
itself, and it'd be quite confusing to have to differentiate what's normal and
what's new.
