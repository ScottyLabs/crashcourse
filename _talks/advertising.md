  This should be a one (maybe two) paragraph description of the talk. In my
  particular case, I maybe want to outline what specificly makes my talk fancy,
  how it got to be that way, and what you can do to give fancy talks as well.

# Advertising your Product
###### Learn how to get your product out there

Got a great product but don’t know how to get it into the hands of the public? Have a great idea but don’t know how to tell everyone about it?  We’ve all been in one of these situations before, and getting out of it takes the right skills.

This talk teaches participants how to correctly and efficiently spread the word about your products. Whether it’s an idea you want heard, a concept you want thought of, or an appliance you want in your customer’s hands, everything needs to be correctly advertised before making it out into the real world. Participants will go over the importance of advertising, what to incorporate into advertising, how to properly advertise, designing a proper advertising, and finish by learning the software needed to create advertisings.

This is a non-medium specific talk on advertising. Following this presentation, participants will have the ability to create still advertisings, such as flyers and pamphlets, to time-based advertisings like videos.
