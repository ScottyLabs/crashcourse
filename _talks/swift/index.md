title: Swift
subtitle: the language of choice for iOS development
description: >
  Ever since Apple released Swift at WWDC in 2014, it's been an instant hit.
  Swift is a very expressive, powerful, and elegant language. In this session,
  we'll take a dive into the syntax of the language so that you can start
  preparing yourself for iOS development.

speaker: Scott Krulcik

_Note this talk is part one of a two-part series on Swift and iOS development. The Swift talk will proceed this one, its description can be found [here](../ios-dev/)._

## What You'll need

### Expected Experience

tldr; If you took 112, you'll be fine. If you only took 110 or AP Comp Sci, you're on the fence, but probably still fine.

While this talk is open to everyone, we expect attendees to have some object-oriented programming (OOP) experience. We will assume you understand terms like 'class', 'object' and 'instantiate', as well as the basic idea of _inheritance_.

### Required Software

__If you plan on using the cluster computers, no preparation is required!__ If you want to use your own computer, you'll need the following:

  - A Mac (if you don't have one, you have to use the cluster computers)
  - Download and install Xcode 7.1, avilable on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)
  - Find your Apple ID username and password (you already have an AppleID if you have any Apple products), which Xcode will ask for on startup.

## Outline
