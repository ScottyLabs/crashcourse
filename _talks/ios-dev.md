_Note this talk is part two of a two-part series on Swift and iOS development.
The Swift talk will precede this one, its description can be found
[here](../swift/)._

## Before the Talk

### Prerequisites

This talk is targeted towards people who already have programming experience
(e.g. took 112), but are unfamiliar with developing iOS applications. If your
previous experience does not include Swift, we strongly recommend that you
attend the Swift workshop that precedes this one.

While this talk is open to everyone, we expect attendees to have some
object-oriented programming (OOP) experience. We will assume you understand
terms like 'class', 'object' and 'instantiate', as well as the basic idea of
_inheritance_.

Preferably, attendees will have some UI or other event-based experience, but
this is not required.

### Required Software

If you plan on using the cluster computers, no preparation is required!

If you want to use your own computer, you'll need the following:

- A Mac (if you don't have one, you have to use the cluster computers)
- Download and install Xcode 8.2, available on the [App Store][xcode]. It is
    important that you install at least Xcode 8, which comes with Swift 3.0.
- Find your Apple ID username and password (you already have an Apple ID if you
    have any Apple products). Xcode will ask for these credentials the first
    time it starts.
