subtitle: make your pages interactive
description: >
  JavaScript is everywhere on the Web. With only a few lines of code, we can
  make immersive web applications, entertaining games, and interactive sites.
  Learning JavaScript is somewhat treacherous if you’re just starting out, so
  we’ll make sure to introduce you to JavaScript in a way that will enable you
  to continue learning more.<br><br>

  Participants in this workshop will complete exercises related to common
  JavaScript tasks.
