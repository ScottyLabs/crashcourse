Learn the foundation of the most practical tool you'll ever use
description: Since its release in 2005, Git has been taking the world by storm
as the de facto version control software for all projects. Since its inception,
Git was designed to be lightning fast, have a small footprint, and be secure.
It's killer feature though is how it enables parallel workflows through its
system of Branching and Merging. We'll help you gain a solid foundation with Git
and show you how to integrate it into your current workflow!


### How to Attend

This talk assumes no prior knowledge of Git, though we hope that both

is recommended, but not required (it will help to know how to `cd` and `ls`).
