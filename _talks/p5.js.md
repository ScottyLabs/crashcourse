  This should be a one (maybe two) paragraph description of the talk. In my
  particular case, I maybe want to outline what specificly makes my talk fancy,
  how it got to be that way, and what you can do to give fancy talks as well.

  Note that you can use __Markdown__ syntax freely within this block, so feel

# p5.js

###### A Graphical Sketchpad for JavaScript

p5.js is a Javascript library that makes coding accessible for everyone. It has
a full set of drawing functionality, so your browser page becomes your
sketchbook. It greatly simplifies the process of coding visual, interactive web
programs and has add-on libraries that allow interaction with other DOM objects
such as text, input, video, webcam and sound.

Participants will learn the basics of p5.js through interactive examples, and
a longer lab session at the end where they will create their own mini p5.js
project!

The slides (and labs) can be found [here](http://tinyurl.com/p5js-webdev).


### Prerequisites

Basic coding abilities, especially with JavaScript, will be helpful, but is not
necessary. This talk is meant for anyone interested in creative computing and
web development.
