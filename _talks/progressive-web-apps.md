# Progresive Web Apps Workshop

Progressive web apps, or PWAs, are specially designed web applications that can be downloaded to your mobile phone and run like a native app. Making one has a lot in common with creating a website, but with a few key extra files and concepts involved.

Progressive Web Apps are user experiences that have the reach of the web, and are:

- __Reliable__ - Load instantly and never show the downasaur, even in uncertain network conditions.
- __Fast__ - Respond quickly to user interactions with silky smooth animations and no janky scrolling.
- __Engaging__ - Feel like a natural app on the device, with an immersive user experience.

This new level of quality allows Progressive Web Apps to earn a place on the user's home screen.

Here is an example of a web app. It generates a QR code from the text you enter.

Benefits:
- As fast and reliable as native apps
- Same appearance and behavior as native apps
- The same code (JavaScript) can work on both Android and IOS
- Build apps for IOS without the requirement of a Mac
- FREE to publish and distribute (unlike Android and IOS apps)

The presentation will teach you some of the basic concepts regarding PWAs such as App Manifests and Service Workers, while the lab will show you how to host and deploy your very own Progressive Web App using Firebase!
