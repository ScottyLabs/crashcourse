subtitle: the language of choice for iOS development
description: >
  Ever since Apple released Swift at WWDC in 2014, it's been an instant hit.
  Swift is a very expressive, powerful, and elegant language. In this session,
  we'll take a dive into the syntax of the language so that you can start
  preparing yourself for iOS development.
speaker: Scott Krulcik

_Note this talk is part one of a two-part series on Swift and iOS development.
The iOS talk will follow this one, its description can be found
[here](../ios-dev/)._

## What You'll need

### Expected Experience

As far as programming experience goes, If you took 15-112, you'll be fine. If
you only took 110 or AP Comp Sci, you're on the fence, but probably still fine.

While this talk is open to everyone, we expect attendees to have some
object-oriented programming (OOP) experience. We will assume you understand
terms like 'class,' 'object,' and 'instantiate,' as well as the basic idea of
_inheritance_.

### Required Software

__If you plan on using the cluster computers, no preparation is required!__ If
you want to use your own computer, you'll need the following:

- A Mac (if you don't have one, you have to use the cluster computers)
- Download and install Xcode 7.1, avilable on the [App Store][xcode]
- Find your Apple ID username and password (you already have an AppleID if you
  have any Apple products), which Xcode will ask for on startup.

## Outline

  1. Syntax Overview
  2. Variables
  3. Control Flow
