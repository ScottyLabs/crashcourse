title: Using the Terminal & Git
subtitle: two ubiquitous technologies for developing software
description: >
  Using the terminal is a core foundation of any software (or even hardware) hack, and basic terminal experience goes a long way—downloading and installing packages and libraries, manipulating and writing code, and accessing frameworks all can be done extraordinarily easily through the terminal. 


  In particular, the version control system Git (and GitHub), is best used through the terminal. Git, besides being easy to use, fun to say, and quite stylish, is a lifesaver during hackathons when anything can cause your whole project to collapse and you don’t have the time to track it down—with Git, reverting is as easy as a single terminal command. You can also make branches with Git to work on features of the project while your teammates work on other features—no more emailing zip files whenever anybody makes a change!


  This workshop will consist of three parts: first, we’ll give a quick rundown of the basic terminal commands and what they do, just in case you haven’t worked with the terminal before. Then, we’ll introduce Git, explain the relationship between Git and GitHub, and then go over the Git workflow and the commands that go with it. Finally, with the aid of provided command cheat sheets, participants will run through a short lab practicing major tasks and Git workflow.
