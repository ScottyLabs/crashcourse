description: >
    Computer Vision can be used to create truly impressive applications in
    a short amount of time during a Hackathon. OpenCV is a popular Open Source
    library that contains pre-implemented computer vision algorithms. In this
    Crash Course, we will briefly go through some applications using OpenCV with
    concrete examples.

    We will cover 3D Stereo Reconstruction, Optical Character Recognition and
    Face Detection.

# Computer Vision with OpenCV
###### See things in a whole new way

OpenCV is an open source image processing library commonly used in computer vision. It provides a set of optimized algorithms for all kinds of computer vision tasks, like object recognition, background / foreground detection, color filtering, and more. It is used by many companies, including Google, Microsoft, Intel, Sony, and more.

Visit our OpenCV talk to learn more about the wonderful applications of Computer Vision and how it can be used in your own project. We will explain how to set up OpenCV with Python, how to use filters, and how OpenCV can be integrated with other tools, like Augmented Reality and Tensorflow. Hope to see you there!
