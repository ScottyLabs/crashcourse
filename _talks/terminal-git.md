title: Using the Terminal & Git
subtitle: two ubiquitous technologies for developing software
description: >
    Using the terminal is a core foundation of any software (or even hardware) hack,
    and basic terminal experience goes a long way—downloading and installing
    packages and libraries, manipulating and writing code, and accessing frameworks
    all can be done extraordinarily easily through the terminal.

In particular, the version control system Git (and GitHub), is best used through
the terminal. Git, besides being easy to use, fun to say, and quite stylish, is
a lifesaver during hackathons when anything can cause your whole project to
collapse and you don’t have the time to track it down—with Git, reverting is as
easy as a single terminal command. You can also make branches with Git to work
on features of the project while your teammates work on other features—no more
emailing zip files whenever anybody makes a change!

This workshop will consist of three parts: first, we’ll give a quick rundown of
the basic terminal commands and what they do, just in case you haven’t worked
with the terminal before. Then, we’ll introduce Git, explain the relationship
between Git and GitHub, and then go over the Git workflow and the commands that
go with it. Finally, with the aid of provided command cheat sheets, participants
will run through a short lab practicing major tasks and Git workflow.

## How to Attend

Register for a GitHub account if you don’t already have one
([GitHub](https://github.com)). Bring a computer, preferably a Mac or Linux
(Windows is acceptable but install [Bash for Ubuntu for Windows prior](install))
with a web browser and a text editor. Make sure you know where the terminal
application is. Note: `cmd.exe` is not a suitable terminal for our purposes.
