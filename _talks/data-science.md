  This should be a one (maybe two) paragraph description of the talk. In my
  particular case, I maybe want to outline what specificly makes my talk fancy,
  how it got to be that way, and what you can do to give fancy talks as well.

  Note that you can use __Markdown__ syntax freely within this block, so feel
  free to emphasize or [insert links](#).
