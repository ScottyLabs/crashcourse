subtitle: the language of choice for iOS development
description: >
  Ever since Apple released Swift at WWDC in 2014, it's been an instant hit.
  Swift is a very expressive, powerful, and elegant language. In this session,
  we'll take a dive into the syntax of the language so that you can start
  preparing yourself for iOS development.
speaker: Scott Krulcik

# Note: You can't simultaneously use this field and the "below the fold"
# content. Perhaps consider linking to the other site there if you have to.
