This section can be treated as "below the fold" content. Use it however you
wish. You may want to elaborate on things people should do before attending,
more details about what you'll cover, etc. You'll want to link to the resources
that you reference, or even write up talk notes here.

Feel free to write as much as you'd like, and you're free to use the full power
of Markdown here.
