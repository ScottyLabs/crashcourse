## Before the Talk

### Required Software

If you plan on using the cluster computers, no preparation is required!

If you want to use your own computer, you'll need the following:

- A Mac (if you don't have one, you have to use the cluster computers)
- Download and install Xcode 8.2, available on the [App Store][xcode]. It is
    important that you install at least Xcode 8, which comes with Swift 3.0.
- Find your Apple ID username and password (you already have an Apple ID if you
    have any Apple products). Xcode will ask for these credentials the first
    time it starts.
