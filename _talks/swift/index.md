  Swift is an expressive, powerful, and elegant language used to develop iOS and

_Note this talk is part one of a two-part series on Swift and iOS development.
The iOS talk will follow this one, its description can be found
[here](../ios-dev/)._

## Before the Talk

### Prerequisites

While this talk is open to everyone, we expect attendees to have some
object-oriented programming (OOP) experience. We will assume you understand
terms like 'class,' 'object,' and 'instantiate,' as well as the basic idea of
_inheritance_.

In explicit terms, successful completion of 15-112 is considered sufficient
experience. If you only took 110 or AP Computer Science, you're on the fence,
but probably still fine.

### Required Software

If you plan on using the cluster computers, no preparation is required!

If you want to use your own computer, you'll need the following:

- A Mac (if you don't have one, you have to use the cluster computers)
- Download and install Xcode 8.2, available on the [App Store][xcode]. It is
    important that you install at least Xcode 8, which comes with Swift 3.0.
- Find your Apple ID username and password (you already have an Apple ID if you
    have any Apple products). Xcode will ask for these credentials the first
    time it starts.

If you are a Vim fan, you might want to check out the [XVim Project][xvim] which
allows you to use you Vim bindings in Xcode. Beware, though, it requires you to
self-sign your copy of Xcode which seems unbelievably sketch.
