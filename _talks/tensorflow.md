title: Deep Learning with Tensorflow
subtitle: state of the art machine learning at your fingertips
description: >
    Deep learning is a word thrown around a lot nowadays, but what is it really?
    What is an artificial neural network? We will be learning the basics of what
    a neural network is, and then implement and train a very simple model to
    classify handwritten digits using python and TensorFlow.

## How to Attend

- Bring a computer with Python 3.5 and TensorFlow (CPU version is fine) installed.
- We recommend the Anaconda route for installing python and TensorFlow.
- If installing TensorFlow in a conda virtual environment (recommended), make sure to install the Spyder IDE within that environment with the command:
    ```
    conda install â€“n tensorflow spyder
    ```

Prior python knowledge is preferred, but not absolutely required.
