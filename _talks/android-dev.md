  Our world is becoming more mobile every day - and there's no mobile platform
  more popular worldwide than Android! Come learn how you can develop great
  applications that reach the 1.4 billion users of Google's open source
  operating system.<br><br>

  In this workshop, participants will build a simple Java application that can
  run on any Android phone. The workshop will go over the fundamentals of
  Android development, such as the Activity lifecycle, using XML Layouts to
  build UI, and interacting with the phone's sensors. Finally, attendees will
  get to run their custom-built application on their own phones and learn how to
  publish an app on the Google Play Store.

This talk is targeted towards those who know the basics of programming, but with
little or no experience in Android development. Some experience with Java or a
similar object-oriented programming language is recommended.

You'll need to have following:

- A laptop (Windows, OSX, or Linux are all fine!)
- Download and install Android Studio, as well as the SDK packages and emulator
  images for the most recent version of Android (the site will walk you through
  this)
- (optional) An Android phone and USB cable to test your app on a real phone!
