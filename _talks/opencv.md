title: Computer Vision with OpenCV
subtitle: see things in a whole new way
description: >
    Computer Vision can be used to create truly impressive applications in
    a short amount of time during a Hackathon. OpenCV is a popular Open Source
    library that contains pre-implemented computer vision algorithms. In this
    Crash Course, we will briefly go through some applications using OpenCV with
    concrete examples.

    We will cover 3D Stereo Reconstruction, Optical Character Recognition and
    Face Detection.

## How to Attend

[Install OpenCV 2.4.9](http://opencv.org/downloads.html)

[Install Python >= 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Code will be uploaded on Github and office hours will be held for further clarification after.
This will be a fairly advanced course so familiarity with python would be useful. Feel free to attend regardless since the code will be up on github.

_This talk is given in partnership with the Computer Vision Club_
