subtitle: come learn the platform that started a revolution
description: >
  Ever since iOS was released, it's been the gold standard for mobile
  development. Now that Apple has released Swift, a new next-generation
  programming language, it's become even more powerful. Come learn all you'll
  need to know to get up and running with iOS development so you can build your
  first app at TartanHacks.

_Note this talk is part two of a two-part series on Swift and iOS development. The Swift talk will proceed this one, its description can be found [here](../swift/)._

## What You'll need

### Expected Experience

This talk is targeted for people who know how to program, but would like to know how to program specifically for iOS. We expect you to be able to understand Swift code, but you don't need to be an expert in it. If you don't have experience with Swift already, we strongly recommend the 7:00PM Swift lecture that precedes this one.

While this talk is open to everyone, we expect attendees to have some object-oriented programming (OOP) experience. We will assume you understand terms like 'class', 'object' and 'instantiate', as well as the basic idea of _inheritance_.

Preferably, attendees will have some UI or other event-based experience, but this is not required.

### Required Software

__If you plan on using the cluster computers, no preparation is required!__ If you want to use your own computer, you'll need the following:

  - A Mac (if you don't have one, you have to use the cluster computers)
  - Download and install Xcode 7.1, avilable on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)
  - Find your Apple ID username and password (you already have an AppleID if you have any Apple products), which Xcode will ask for on startup.

## Outline

We will be loosely following Apple's quickstart guide, but the application we make will be slightly different to highlight some useful tools.

  1. Setting up an XCode Project
  2. MVC Paradigm
  3. Creating a View in Storyboard
  4. Creating a UIViewController Subclass
  5. Connecting View To Controller
  6. Creating a Model
  7. Populate View From Model
  8. Using Parse
  9. What Next?
