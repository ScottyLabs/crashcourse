  This should be a one (maybe two) paragraph description of the talk. In my
  particular case, I maybe want to outline what specificly makes my talk fancy,
  how it got to be that way, and what you can do to give fancy talks as well.

  Note that you can use __Markdown__ syntax freely within this block, so feel
  free to emphasize or [insert links](#).

We’ll go over the basics of using TensorFlow in Python. The bulk of the talk will go over how to create a digit recognizer, i.e. a network that can recognize images of the numbers 0 through 9. In the process, we’ll go over terms in machine learning, including cost functions and backpropagation. If we have time, we’ll go over how to implement other machine learning techniques in TensorFlow.
No machine learning experience is required. It’d be helpful if the attendees are familiar with Python. It would also help if they install TensorFlow beforehand.
